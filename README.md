# CS1B
All of my java projects I created while taking the class CS1B at Foothill Community College (2022). 
This includes card games, barcode scanners, matrix calculators, and more. These projects employ key java programming
concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, recursion, generics, JavaFX and more.
